Exercise questions for Lesson 1

For this excercise we will primarily be practicing the following topics:

-  Assigning variables
-  Print message to console
-  Read user input from console log.
-  Final Keyword

Before proceeding, please take a look at the ConsoleScanner.java file that I have provided,
it contains information & code that you can refer to refer to when completing the below questions.

==========================================================================================

Q1.  Under Lesson2 directory create a new Java class "HelloWorld.java" and print the texts
    "Hello-world" to console.  To print text to console you can use the Java function

    `System.out.println("")`

Q2.  Using ConsoleScanner.java as reference, create a new program ConsoleScannerTwo.java
    Modify that program to read in 5 number inputs instead of the default two.  Then print the 5 inputted integers.

Q3.  Write a program called SumScanner.java to take two numbers inputs from user and print sum the numbers.
    Use ConsoleScanner.java as reference - if required.

Q4.  Write a program called AreaScanner.java to ask the user for a length & width input, then calculate
    the area based on Length and width, then print the result.
    Use ConsoleScanner.java as reference - if required.

Q5.  Write a program called VolumeScanner.java to ask the user for (length, width, and height) - then
    calculate the volume based on those inputted measurements.

    Use ConsoleScanner.java as reference - if required.

            pieConstant = 3.14324;
        }
